Here the code and data belonging to the paper from Leupold/Weigel/BÃ¤r is provided.

i) Simulations
--------------

The simulations are presented in different figures in the paper, a script named fig*_script.m is provided to reproduce any figure. Note all these scripts call the function epg_rfps.m
Forther explanation is given in the header of the individual scripts. (E.g., to reproduce Fig 6, the variable "substance" has to be manually set in the code.)

ii) Data
--------------
The SNR data points as displayed in Fig.3 are provided in fig3_script.m, below the comments "%snr data per flip angle for silicone oil" and "%snr data for H20 + CuSO4", respectively.
